# Inspiration
As third-year college students, everyone on our team has lost time connected to other students on campus and in the community. We've become more isolated than ever, and over the last 11 months sheltering in place, we've grown more and more anxious about the state of the world. When outside feels dangerous, it can be harder than ever to feel like you can make a difference, and we've seen hopelessness in our communities grow with covid surges, political unrest, and the impeachment and widespread violence highlighted in the news cycle. We envisioned our app as a new platform to connect people towards social change. Inspired by the crowdsourcing of kickstarter, we wanted to create a space for people to reach out to their community to make a difference, with all types of community service.

# What our hack does
Our hack is a javaFX and CSS based GUI app. When users open up the GUI, they can create a call-to-action for a community service task they want to recruit helpers for, including information like the time and how many people needed. Once they create their event, they can also browse all types of community service events on our home page, and sign up to help out in their community, or connect with others hoping to make a difference. To create these functionalities, we created clickable buttons and data tracking with javaFX in IntelliJ IDEA, and laid out the app in SceneBuilder. One big issue we faced was how to record and filter available community service events, whether it was with local documents or a cloud-based database. We also worked extensively with CSS to format and style our SceneBuilder framework.
